# Literate Programming

From Wikipedia:

> Literate programming is a programming paradigm introduced by Donald Knuth in which a computer program is given an explanation of its logic in a natural language, such as English, interspersed with snippets of **macros** and traditional source code, from which compilable source code can be generated.[^1]

From Eric:

> It's basically writing and explaining your code all in one file, like comments on steroids.
