In this example, we will use SQL to extract data from a database (SQLite file) and R to analyze the data to determine which actor or actress was most likely to appear in a Martin Sheen movie, other than Martin Sheen himself. This exercise is loosely based on the 2020 version of Harvard's open CS50x online course.^[https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/psets/7/movies/]

First, we need to make a connection to the database:

```{r db_connection, echo=TRUE}
db_file <- "src/data/movies.db"
con <- DBI::dbConnect(RSQLite::SQLite(), db_file)
```

<br>

Let's start by extracting the data from the database file we need to conduct this analysis into the `movie_data` variable:

```{sql connection=con, output.var="movie_data"}
select movies.id as movie_id
  ,movies.title as movie_title
  ,movies.year as movie_year
  ,people.name as star_name
  ,people.birth as star_dob
from movies
join stars on stars.movie_id = movies.id
join people on stars.person_id = people.id;
```

```{r db_disconnect, include=FALSE}
DBI::dbDisconnect(con)
```


<br>

The `movie_data` data frame contains the following data:

```{r movie_data_table}
head(movie_data)
```

<br>

With the data in an R data frame, we can identify all movies starring Martin Sheen by name and ID by:

- Filtering `movie_data` to only records where `star_name` is 'Martin Sheen' and `star_dob` is 1958.
- Keeping only the `movie_id` and `movie_title` fields.
- De-duplicating the results to ensure one record per unique combination of `movie_id`, `movie_title`, and `movie_year`.

```{r martin_sheen_movies}
library(dplyr)

martin_sheen_movies <- movie_data %>% 
  filter(star_name == "Martin Sheen", star_dob == 1940) %>% 
  select(movie_id, movie_title, movie_year) %>% 
  distinct()

head(martin_sheen_movies)
```

<br>

The script below counts the number of Martin Sheen movies released, by decade, and plots the result.

```{r movies_by_decade}
library(ggplot2)

movies_by_decade <- martin_sheen_movies %>% 
  mutate(decade = (movie_year %/% 10) * 10) %>% 
  group_by(decade) %>% 
  tally()

ggplot(movies_by_decade, aes(decade, n)) +
  geom_col() +
  geom_text(aes(label = n), vjust = 1.2, color = "white") +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(
    x = "Decade",
    y = "# of Movies Released",
    title = "Count of Movies Starring Martin Sheen, by Decade"
  )
```

<br>

Given that listing of movies, let's identify which actor or actress *other* than Martin Sheen appears the most times:

```{r most_frequent_costar}
most_frequent_costar <- movie_data %>% 
  inner_join(martin_sheen_movies, by = c("movie_id", "movie_title", "movie_year")) %>% 
  filter(star_name != "Martin Sheen") %>% 
  group_by(star_name) %>% 
  tally() %>% 
  filter(n == max(n))

as.list(most_frequent_costar)
```

![It's this fellow here.](src/img/phil_cousineau.jpg)

<br>

To finish, up, let's identify which four movies Martin Sheen and Phil Cousineau appeared in together:

```{r which_four_movies}
which_four_movies <- movie_data %>% 
  inner_join(martin_sheen_movies, by = c("movie_id", "movie_title", "movie_year")) %>% 
  filter(star_name == "Phil Cousineau") %>% 
  select(movie_id, movie_title) %>% 
  distinct()
  
knitr::kable(which_four_movies)
```
